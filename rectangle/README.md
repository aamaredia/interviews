# Find rectangle in a 2D Array

## Problem Statement
Imagine we have an image. We'll represent this image as a simple 2D array where every pixel is a 1 or a 0. The image you get is known to have a single rectangle of 0s on a background of 1s.

Write a function that takes in the image and returns the coordinates of the rectangle of 0's -- either top-left and bottom-right; or top-left, width, and height.

Sample output variations:
x: 3, y: 2, width: 3, height: 2
2,3 3,5 -- row,column of the top-left and bottom-right corners
3,2 5,3 -- x,y of the top-left and bottom-right corners (as long as you stay consistent, either format is fine)

## Other information gathered
* A rectangle always exists within the image
* Not interesting in accounting for all bad inputs for image

## Time Taken:
30 minutes
